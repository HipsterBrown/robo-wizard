XState FSM also provides a minimal API to power the internal logic of `robo-wizard`, with consistent updates and dedicated team behind it. This refactor was purely internal and did not affect the public API of the package.\\n\\nAnother advantage of adopting XState is the ability to fire \\"entry\\" actions that can be configured as options when creating the machine, separate from the schema. This feature lead to the `createWizard` function from `robo-wizard` accepting its first action parameter for navigating [routed steps](https://github.com/HipsterBrown/robo-wizard/pull/17). \\n\\n```typescript\\nimport { createWizard } from \'robo-wizard\';\\nconst wizard = createWizard(\\n  [\'first\', \'second\', \'third\'],\\n  { firstName: \'\', lastName: \'\' }\\n  {\\n    navigate: () => history.pushState({}, \'\', `/${wizard.currentStep}`)\\n  }\\n);\\nwindow.addEventListener(\'popstate\', () => {\\n  const stepFromPath = window.location.pathname.split(\'/\').pop();\\n  if (stepFromPath !== wizard.currentStep) {\\n    wizard.sync({ step: stepFromPath })\\n  }\\n})\\n```\\n\\n---\\n\\nWhile these updates are exciting enough for a single blog post, there\'s _one more thing_.\\n\\nThe core `robo-wizard` package is no longer alone in the [repo](https://github.com/HipsterBrown/robo-wizard); the first official framework integration packages have been published: [`@robo-wizard/react`](/docs/api/modules/robo_wizard_react) & [`@robo-wizard/react-router`](/docs/api/modules/robo_wizard_react_router)\\n\\nThese packages make getting started with Robo Wizard and React much easier than before, while the [other framework examples still exist](https://github.com/HipsterBrown/robo-wizard/tree/main/examples) until more demand motivates their own official integrations. The repo is now in a better place to support adding more packages through the help of [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces). \\n\\nIt feels good to get this project started again. There\'s plenty of work ahead; from documentation and educational content to feature development to expand the functionality to as many environments as possible. If any of this sounds interesting to you, please drop a line on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hipsterbrown) or start a [discussion](https://github.com/HipsterBrown/robo-wizard/discussions) in the project repo.\\n\\nCheers and thanks for making the web a bit more magical!"}]}')}}]);
